Personal Data Set For Data 115

## Significance
I grew up on a dry-land wheat farm, so wheat has always been a part of my life. I chose to further infestigate this data to get a better understanding of how wheat yields vary from state to state and county to county.

## Processing
This data is describing the yield and total number of acres of wheat in the every country in the US. From this, I calculated the bushels/acre for every county in the country. To clean this data, I removed any columns that showed all of the same value, or were blank. There were also some rows with values that were not given due to privacy reasons, but this is also not vluable for my analysis, so I removed them. I got this data from the USDA (https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/#DE398F62-AD6A-36D0-BC08-3A71D941943A).
